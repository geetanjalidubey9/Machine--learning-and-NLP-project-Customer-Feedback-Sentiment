Business Problem:
The business problem I am addressing is the inefficiency and inconsistency in the **return and exchange process**. Typically, when a customer requests a return, **customer support** has to manually check multiple factors to determine if the product is eligible for return. This process is time-consuming, often leading to delays, increased workloads for support teams, and potentially a **poor customer experience**. Additionally, **ineligible returns** or **manual interventions** may cause dissatisfaction and result in **higher operational costs**.

### **Project Goal:**
The goal of your project is to **automate the return eligibility decision-making process** using a **predictive model**, thus solving the inefficiencies in the system:
- **Eligible returns** are automatically approved by the model, speeding up the process and reducing workload.
- **Ineligible returns** are flagged for **manual review** by the customer support team, ensuring that exceptions can still be managed appropriately.
- **Reduced operational costs** and **improved customer satisfaction** by providing quicker responses and accurate predictions.

This predictive model reduces human intervention in straightforward cases while ensuring the support team is involved only when necessary, making the entire process more **efficient, consistent, and cost-effective**.
