Product Exchange Decision System
Project Overview
The Product Exchange Decision System is a machine learning-based solution designed for e-commerce platforms to make informed decisions on product exchanges. The system analyzes the past history of specific products to determine whether a product should be allowed for exchange. If the product has a good history with few or no issues, it is not allowed to be returned. If the product has a problematic history, the exchange request is processed.

Features
Product History Analysis: Evaluates the history of each product based on past exchanges, customer feedback, and return rates.
Exchange Decision Making: Automatically decides whether a product should be eligible for exchange based on its historical performance.
Customizable Thresholds: Allows administrators to set thresholds for what constitutes a "good" or "bad" product history.
Real-time Decision Processing: Provides instant feedback to users on whether their exchange request is accepted or rejected.
Dataset
The system is trained on a dataset that includes:

Product IDs and descriptions
Historical exchange and return data for each product
Customer feedback and ratings
Reasons for past exchanges or returns
Time frames between purchases and return requests
Model Training
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature engineering to extract relevant features, such as average return rate, average customer rating, and the frequency of exchanges.
Model Selection:

Various models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, are considered.
The final model is selected based on its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of a product being legitimately problematic.
Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure that it effectively discriminates between products that should or should not be exchanged.
Installation
To set up the system on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
A dataset containing historical product exchange and return data.
